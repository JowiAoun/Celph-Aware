# Celph-Aware

- Create a simple UI that lets you provide what you want to do, and returns what are the benefits of that and the downsides of that
- Create a green and a red button that represent the positive and negative choice
- Keep track of the number of positive and negative choices taken
- Have the AI assign an importance score (1-100) for that

- ??? Theme it after The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
